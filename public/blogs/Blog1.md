# St. Paul!

Apostle saint Paul was a tent builder, missionary, writer, preacher, teacher, theologian, evangelist, counselor, prophet, miracle worker, prisoner and martyr. His life story is read like a fairy tale. We won't be wrong if we say Paul looked like three different people in history :-
* 1st. A Pharisee that worships the Lord.
* 2nd. A passenger who doesn't get touched and
* 3rd one. A great writer.

He has written many books, travelled to many countries than many businessmen and visited the world that was known at that time, a loyal friend to his friends, a problem maker for his opponents, an incomparable solution to the debaters, a man who was a man of mockery before the law.

The apostle was the one whom God called through Jesus Christ to take the gospel to the ends of the earth. When they say I am better than Paul, I get shot. He is going to sell me. It's not like I'm better than him. I like Brother Paul!.

# Bro, I hate politics, a friend of ours used to say.

In this place I smell goat's poop. I would have been happy if Tehadso would have taken the political shape of its renaissance. But he needs a brave one! 
Just like the renaissance, just like Calvin, just like Luther 

Once upon a time, John Calvin used to read that there were people whom we had forgotten in the name of Reformation. Then in one of the letters Brother John wrote, 
> "Servetus offers to come hither, if it be agreeable to me." But I am unwilling to pledge my word for his safety, for if he shall come, I shall never allow him to depart alive, provided my authority be of any avail. ” - Letter to Farel, 13 February 1546"

Translation of Heritage :- 
> "Even if I find it on the verge of death, I will finish it" 

I felt cold when I read it. Here is a brother giving a comment on this issue- 

> "Whoever shall now contend that it is unjust to put heretics and blasphemers to death, knowingly and willingly incur their guilt. It is not human authority that speaks, it is God who speaks and prescribes a perpetual rule for His Church. 

Translation: 

> "If anyone now knows the hypocrites and insults and argues that it is unjust to be killed, the argument and complaint are not with the authority and ability of human beings, but the debate and complaint are with God." 

This is the eternal rule for the church. 

"Let's go and rest... Forgetting is a forever process ... It means it is available in the middle of the village. [Bay'Zewaye Jeleska in war, his followers say he was tired of receiving a lot of toxins and was shot by his friends. 

According to the prophet written by his followers the death of brother Calvin is like this:-

> Had a rough and dry straw while preached the last sermon. He used to think he was on the stage where he was delivering his sermon. When he repeatedly thinks, the blood vessels in his lungs are in danger of bursting.

# May his soul rest in peace! And Brother Luther was a little different..
